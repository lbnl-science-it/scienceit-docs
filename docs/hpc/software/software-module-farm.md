!!! note "Software Module Farm (SMF) Service"

    For an overview of the Software Module Farm (SMF) as a service on non-Lawrencium systems, please follow [this link](https://it.lbl.gov/service/scienceit/high-performance-computing/scientific-cluster-services/software-module-farm/){:target="_blank"} {{ ext }}. In this page, we will focus on the Software Module Farm (SMF) software packages and their usage on the Lawrencium cluster.


The Software Module Farm provides a comprehensive and well-tested suite of software modules for Lawrencium users. Several types of software modules are available:

1. **Tools**: Tool modules are built and compiled with the default system `gcc` compiler. They have no other dependencies. For the current operating system, the `gcc` system compiler is `gcc 8.5.0`.
2. **Compilers**: Other common compilers and newer versions of `gcc`; for example: `gcc 11.4.0`. Many applications and libraries not found in the **Tools** are built with these compilers and can be accessed after loading the corresponding compiler.
3. **Languages**: Language modules include additional compilers and interpreters for specific languages such as `python`, `R` and `julia`.
4. **Applications**: Domain specific applications such as biology and machine learning packages.
5. **Submodules**: Submodules include libraries and packages which depend on a particular compiler or language module. Due to this dependency, submodules will only be visible once the associated language or core compiler module has been loaded. For example, `hdf5` submodule is only visible once you load `gcc` and `openmpi` modules.

See the [Module Management](module-management.md) page for details on how to use the `module` command for module management on Lawrencium.

## Software installation by Users

Users are encouraged to install domain scientific software packages or local software module farms in their home or group space. Users donâ€™t have admin rights, but most software can be installed with the flag `--prefix=/dir/to/your/path`.
