# Install software using Spack

!!! warning "Spack on Lawrencium"

    Please follow the [Spack on Lawrencium](spack-on-lawrencium.md) page before continuing with this page.

## Software Availability and Variants

`spack list <packagename>` and `spack info <packagename>` are useful to check is a package is available to install through Spack and what variants are possible to install.

Throughout this page, we will take `hdf5` package as an example. `hdf5` is already installed in our software module farm; in this page, we will install a slightly different variant and version of the `hdf5` library through spack and also make a module file for it.
