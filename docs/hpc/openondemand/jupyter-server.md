# Jupyter Server

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that enables you to create and share documents that can contain a mix of live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. This is an introduction to using Jupyter notebooks on Lawrencium.

Before getting started, make sure you have [access to the Lawrencium cluster], as you will need your LRC username and one-time password to log in.

As described next, you can start a Jupyter notebook via the Open OnDemand service, which allows you to operate completely via your web browser on your local computer (e.g., your laptop).
