# Cf1 (Californium) Intel Phi Cluster

Californium is an Intel Phi Knights Landing processor partition within the Lawrencium cluster. The system is named after the radioactive chemical element with the symbol Cf and atomic number 98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions).

The partition consists of 70 Dell nodes each equipped with a single Intel Phi Knights Landing 7210 64-core 1.3Ghz processor and 192GB 2400Mhz memory. Users of the NERSC Cori system can use these nodes for development
