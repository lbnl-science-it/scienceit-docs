# User Accounts

### How to get a user account on Lawrencium / How to add additional users to your project?

Accounts are added on a first come, first served basis upon approval of the PI for the project. For security reasons, access to Lawrencium will be through the use of one-time password tokens. Users will be required to complete  user account requests at [myLRC portal](https://mylrc.lbl.gov/) in order to get their one-time password token generator and their account.

!!! note "Closing User Accounts"

    The PI for the project or the main contact is responsible for notifying HPCS to close user accounts and the disposition of the userâ€™s software, files and data. In some cases, users share software and data from their home directory and others may depend on them. For this reasons, only account terminations have to be requested by PI, the main account or the user of the account. Users accounts are not automatically deactivated upon termination of an employee because many people change their employment status, but remain engaged with the project. Send your requests at [myLRC portal](https://mylrc.lbl.gov/).

### How to get an Account on the UX8 

UX8 is a 4-core, 15GB general purpose VM server that is available to users for doing programming development on their HPC applications. It features the same programming environment as is available on the Lawrencium cluster and has licenses for Mathematica.  Users should go to [http://lbl.servicenowservices.com](http://lbl.servicenowservices.com) and login using their LBNL LDAP username and password to make the request. Berkeley Lab PIs can also use the form to submit account requests for non-LBNL users associated with their project.

Questions regarding requesting new or removing accounts can be directed to [hpcshelp@lbl.gov](mailto:hpcshelp@lbl.gov).
