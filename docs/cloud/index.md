The IT Division encourages the use of cloud computing for science as an effective way to to meet specific research and computing needs. Many researchers have found that cloud computing works well for quickly bringing up computing infrastructure and that it scales well for bursty workloads such as data releases. Others have found that cloud tools for machine learning, search and workflow orchestration are very effective.

To facilitate cloud use at Berkeley Lab, Science IT has secured master payer contracts with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. These master payer agreements provide LBNL scientists, staff, and other affiliated researchers with access to the full suite of AWS and GCP services without use of a purchase order or need to create a contract vehicle.  This is considered a self-managed cloud offering as you are expected to manage your own usage of services in your chosen cloud environment.
