# **Cloud Computing Services**

The Science IT Group acts as the primary point of contact for researchers at Berkeley Lab to access commercial cloud computing service providers. Berkeley Lab and/or Department of Energy has secured master payer contracts with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. These master payer agreements provide LBNL scientists, staff, and other affiliated researchers with access to the full suite of AWS and GCP services without use of a purchase order or need to create a contract vehicle.  

**Note:** Cloud computing services are a self-managed service offering. Users assume full responsibility for usage of cloud services. Users are responsible for all costs incurred by their cloud usage regardless of their budgetary constraints. Users are advised to shut down services and rented instances when not in use, and should implement appropriate security controls to prevent unauthorized use of API keys. 

**Some users have unintentionally incurred extremely high costs due to user errors!**
