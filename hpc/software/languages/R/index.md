# Using R on Lawrencium

Version `4.4.0` of R is available to users; the R module can be loaded as:

```
module load r
```

Some commonly used r-packages are already installed with the R module available on the system. To view the list of packages already installed, use the following command in the R command prompt (either in your terminal or RStudio session on Open OnDemand):

```
installed.packages()
```

Another module `r-spatial` is available for a standard set of R packages for spatial data:

```
module load r-spatial
```
